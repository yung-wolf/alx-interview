# 0x0A. Prime Game

These are two files that are part of my solution to the "0-Prime Game" exercise.

The first file, `0-prime_game.py`, contains a function called `is_prime()` that takes an integer as input and returns `True` if the integer is prime, and `False` otherwise.

The second file, `0-main.py`, contains a function called `main()` that plays a game where the user guesses prime numbers until they guess a number that is not prime.

To run the game, simply open a terminal or command prompt, navigate to the directory containing the two files, and type `python 0-main.py`. You can then start guessing prime numbers!

Note that this game is intended to be a simple exercise in using functions and loops, and it is not meant to be a particularly challenging game.

I hope you find these files helpful! Let me know if you have any questions.
