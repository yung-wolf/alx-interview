# 0x09. Island Perimeter

This directory contains my solutions the Island Perimeter project, which is to calculate the perimeter of an island.

The problem is as follows:

Given a grid containing 1's (land) and 0's (water), count the number of 1's that are surrounded by water. An island is surrounded by water if the grid is water everywhere except for a single row or column of land. The island doesn't have "lakes" (water inside that isn't connected to the water around the island). One-cell wide strips of water around the shore are considered to be part of the shore.

The solutions are in Python.

There are two solutions:

1. [0-island_perimeter.py](0-island_perimeter.py)
   This solution is a Python function that takes a 2D grid as input and returns the perimeter of the island.

2. [0-main.py](0-main.py)
   This solution is a Python script that takes a 2D grid as input and prints the perimeter of the island. The main function is defined in [0-island_perimeter.py](0-island_perimeter.py).
